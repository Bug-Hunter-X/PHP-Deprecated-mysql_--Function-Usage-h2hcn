This code suffers from a potential issue related to the usage of the `mysql_*` functions. These functions are deprecated and have been removed from recent PHP versions.  Using them leads to security vulnerabilities and compatibility problems. The code attempts to connect to a MySQL database and perform queries using outdated functions.  This is not secure and will not work with newer PHP installations.
